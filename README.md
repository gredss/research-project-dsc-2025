# 1. Deep Learning for Multiclass Plant Disease Classification from Multi-Species Leaf Data Fusion
[coming soon]

This project applies transfer learning to classify plant diseases using five state-of-the-art CNN models: **VGG16**, **ResNet50**, **InceptionV3**, **Xception**, and **EfficientNetV2**. Each model is pretrained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on a curated dataset containing 26 plant disease categories.

### Highlights
- **Dataset** - 15,000+ images of healthy and diseased leaves
- **Models** - Top-performing CNN architectures with custom classification heads
- **Best Accuracy** - >95% (VGG16 on test data)
- **Techniques** - Transfer learning, fine-tuning, data augmentation, early stopping
- **Evaluation** - Accuracy, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix
